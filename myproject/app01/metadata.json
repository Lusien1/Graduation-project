covers __49 states of the USA__. The accident data were collected from __February 2016 to March 2023__, using multiple APIs that provide streaming traffic incident (or event) data. These APIs broadcast traffic data captured by various entities, including the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road networks. The dataset currently contains approximately __7.7 million__ accident records. For more information about this dataset, please visit [here](https://smoosavi.org/datasets/us_accidents).\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\nIf you use this dataset, please kindly cite the following papers:\n\n- Moosavi, Sobhan, Mohammad Hossein Samavatian, Srinivasan Parthasarathy, and Rajiv Ramnath. \u201C[A Countrywide Traffic Accident Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05409).\u201D, 2019.\n\n- Moosavi, Sobhan, Mohammad Hossein Samavatian, Srinivasan Parthasarathy, Radu Teodorescu, and Rajiv Ramnath.

It contains accident data collected from February 2016 to March 2023 for the Contiguous United States. For more details about this dataset, please visit [here]. \n\n### Inspiration\nThe US-Accidents dataset can be used for numerous applications, such as real-time car accident prediction, studying car accident hotspot locations, casualty analysis, extracting cause and effect rules to predict car accidents, and studying the impact of precipitation or other environmental stimuli on accident occurrence. The most recent release of the dataset can also be useful for studying the impact of COVID-19 on traffic behavior and accidents.\n\n### Sampled Data (New!)\nFor those requiring a smaller, more manageable dataset, [a sampled version is available which includes 500,000 accidents](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U3u8QYzLjnEaSurtZfSAS_oh9AT2Mn8X). This sample is extracted from the original dataset for easier handling and analysis. \n\n### Other Details\nPlease note that the dataset may be missing data for certain days, which could be due to network connectivity issues during data collection. Regrettably, the dataset will no longer be updated, and this version should be considered the latest. \n\n### Usage Policy and Legal Disclaimer\nThis dataset is being distributed solely for research purposes under the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-ShareAlike license (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0).
